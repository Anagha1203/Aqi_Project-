# Aqi_Project
The libraries used in our model are NumPy, pandas, plotly, datetime, and warnings. The datasets used are based on Indian AQI records which is based on the measurement of emissions of particles (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO).We will analyze the AQI in India by comparing the performance of the model before and after the lockdown, as almost every country saw a major change in the climate due to lockdown and visualize the AQI stations per city in India
